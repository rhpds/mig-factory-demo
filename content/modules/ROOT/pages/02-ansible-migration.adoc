= VM Migration with the Ansible Automation Platform

*SAY:*

In the previous module, you saw how easy it is to migrate VMs from VMware to OpenShift Virtualization using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization.

While this process is effective and doesnâ€™t take too long to complete, how can we speed up the process and achieve scale when needed?

Here, we introduce Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) to the mix.

== Summary

*SAY:*

In this demo, we used the Ansible Automation Platform to migrate our VMs to OpenShift Virtualization, bringing automation to the process and all the benefits that come with it: speed, scale, and consistency.

Furthermore, we can now easily integrate this process with other automation workflows and automate the lifecycle of your virtual machines. While Day 2 and Day 3 operations are not covered in this demo, there are separate resources available to assist you with those.
