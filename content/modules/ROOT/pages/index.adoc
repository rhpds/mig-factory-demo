= OpenShift Virtualization Migration Demo

This demo is geared for VMware administrators.

With this in mind, please use a minimum of OpenShift and Kubernetes terminology.
For example, avoid the use of the term *Pod*, as it can be confusing to VMware administrators unfamiliar with OpenShift.

**This demo is divided into three parts:**

1. xref:01-mtv-migration.adoc[VM Migration with the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization]
2. xref:02-ansible-migration.adoc[VM Migration with the Ansible Automation Platform]
3. xref:03-day2-operations.adoc[Day 2 Operations]

Feel free to deliver both parts or choose the one that best fits your audience.
