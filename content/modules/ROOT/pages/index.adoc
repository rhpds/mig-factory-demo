= Migrating Virtual Machines Demo

NOTE: This demo is geared for VMware administrators.
With this in mind, please use a minimum of OpenShift and Kubernetes terminology.
For example, avoid the use of the term *Pod*, as it can be confusing to VMware administrators unfamiliar with OpenShift.

== Introduction

*SAY:*

OpenShift Virtualization includes a simple way to migrate your existing virtual machines from other hypervisors with the included Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV).

This demo highlights the migration of virtual machines from VMware vSphere to OpenShift.

We will use the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization to migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere to OpenShift Virtualization.

== Environment Setup

In this section you'll find all access information for the environment used in this demo.

* *VMware vCenter:* https://{vcenter_console}
** *vCenter User:* {vcenter_user}
** *vCenter Password:* {vcenter_password}
* *OpenShift Web Console:* {openshift_web_console}
** *Admin User:* {openshift_admin_user}
** *Admin Password:* {openshift_admin_password}

== Review the VMware Environment and Sample Application
*SAY:*

A three-tier application has been deployed on VMware for us to migrate to OpenShift.

The application is accessible from the following link: http://webapp.vc.opentlc.com/[WebApp^].
It will display a visitor counter, and the hostname of the webserver that returned your request.

This simple application consists of four virtual machines:

* One HAproxy system that redirects traffic to the web servers.
* One Linux system running a MariaDB database.
* Two Microsoft Windows servers with IIS hosting a PHP application connecting to the database.

NOTE: One benefit of migrating to OpenShift is that, if you have a simple loadbalancer configuration, you do not need to migrate the HAproxy VM (which acts as a load balancer).
OpenShift already handles network traffic and load balancing natively, if desired.

Now, we will navigate to the VMware vCenter and take note of the names of the virtual machines we want to migrate.

* `database`
* `winweb01`
* `winweb02`

*DO:*

. Navigate to VMware vCenter: https://{vcenter_console}[vCenter Console^]
+
image::module-01/NN_Launch_vSphere.png[link=self, window=blank, width=30%]
+
. Click *LAUNCH VSPHERE CLIENT*
. Login with the following credentials:
- *User:* {vcenter_user}
- *Password:* {vcenter_password}
+
image::module-01/NN_vSphere_Login.png[link=self, window=blank, width=30%]

. By default, you’ll land in the *Inventory* view at the top of the navigation tree.
Click the *Workloads* icon and expand the navigation tree until you see the folder that matches your username and the four VMs under it.
Click the *VMs* tab at the top of the screen to view the VM details.
+
image::module-01/00_Workload_VM_List.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

*SAY:*

For the purposes of this demo, we have *Windows* and *CentOS* VMs to migrate. Check the operating system details by looking at the virtual machines.

*DO:*

. Click `winweb01` in the list of virtual machines.
+
image::module-01/NN_vSphere_VM_Details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

== Migration Toolkit for Virtualization

*SAY:*

Let’s now look at how we’re going to migrate the virtual machines.

The Migration Toolkit for Virtualization has *Providers* that support various virtualization platforms.

We’ll be using the VMware Provider as our migration source and the Host Provider as our migration target.

Let's have a look at them now.

*DO:*

. Open the following link to open the list of OpenShift Virtualization console and see the list of providers.
+
link:{openshift_web_console}/k8s/ns/openshift-mtv/forklift.konveyor.io%7Ev1beta1~Provider[Provider List Screen^]
+
image::module-01/NN_Virtualization_Console_Login.png[link=self, window=blank, width=30%]
+
. Administrator login is available with:

* *Username:* {openshift_admin_user}
* *Password:* {openshift_admin_password}
+
. You will be taken directly to the list of migration providers.

image::module-01/NN_Migration_Providers.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

*SAY:*

Our list of providers contains two providers: *Host* and *VMware*.

VMware will be the source provider, and Host is of type OpenShift, which will be the target provider.

=== Create a Migration Plan

*SAY:*

Now that we have reviewed our environment, it is time for us to create a Migration Plan.

The Migration Plan selects which VMs to migrate from VMware vSphere to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization and specifies how to execute the migration.

First, we'll create a plan that indicates the source provider, *VMware* and the VMs we want to migrate.

*DO:*

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *Plans for virtualization* and press *Create plan*.
+
link:{openshift_web_console}/k8s/ns/openshift-mtv/forklift.konveyor.io%7Ev1beta1~Plan[Link to Create Migration Plan^]
+
image::module-01/NN_Create_VMware_Plan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. You will be asked to select the source provider that you intend to migrate from.
Click on the *VMware* tile, and the next page will open immediately.
+
image::module-01/NN_VMware_Source_Provider.png[link=self, window=blank, width=50%]

*SAY:*

Next, we'll select the VMs that we want to migrate.

CAUTION: As an aside: The VMs are auto-discovered by Migration Toolkit for Virtualization, and are organized into "Concerns."
Concerns are an advanced feature,  part of the Validation service that uses policy rules to check the suitability of each virtual machine (VM) for migration.
The Validation service generates a list of concerns for each VM, which are stored in the Provider Inventory service as VM attributes. The web console displays the concerns for each VM in the provider inventory.

*DO:*

. On the next page select the three VMs you would like to move:

* `database`
* `winweb01`
* `winweb02`

WARNING: The VMs are far too large to migrate in this short demo. We have VMs that are already migrated to show.

. Click *Next*.
+
image::module-01/NN_Create_Migration_Plan_2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

*SAY:*

On this screen we provide details for of the migration plan.

We will give our plan a name, and make sure we're using the proper network maps and storage maps.

*DO:*

. Several details will already be filled in for you, but you will have to make a few minor modifications to ensure that the VMs land in the correct namespace, and that the networks and storage options map correctly.
+
Please fill in your migration plan with the following values:

* Plan name: *move-webapp-vmware*
* Network map: *Pod Networking*
* Storage map: *ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization*
+
NOTE: Storage and network mappings should be automatically detected from the discovered virtual machines, but make sure to double-check that the correct values are set as described in this guide.
+
. Click *Create migration plan*.
+
image::module-01/NN_Create_Migration_Plan_3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

*SAY:*

Now we wait a moment for our Migration Plan to be analysed by the system and ready to start the migration.

NOTE: Sometimes it takes a few minutes to create the plan.
You can scroll down to the bottom of the page to show the *Conditions* and progress of plan preparation.
You can also click through the tab bar on the top to show details about the required *Resources* for the migration have been computed.

Let's start our migration!

*DO:*

. You will be taken to a new screen where you will see that the plan for migration is being made ready.
+
image::module-01/NN_Await_Migration_Plan_Ready.png[link=self, window=blank, width=50%]
+
. After a few moments the plan will become *Ready*, click on the green "Play" button in the center of the window to start the migration process.
+
image::module-01/NN_Migration_Plan_Ready.png[link=self, window=blank, width=30%]
+
. You will be presented with a confirmation box to begin the migration, click on the *Start* button.
+
image::module-01/NN_Start_Migration_Modal.png[link=self, window=blank, width=50%]
+
. A progress bar will appear in the center of the screen along with the status of *0 of 3 VMs migrated*.
+
image::module-01/NN_Migration_Plan_Running.png[link=self, window=blank, width=50%]

*SAY:*

We'll want to see the progress of our migration.
So let's click on the progress bar to see the status of our migration.

*DO:*

. Click on the *0 of 3 VMs migrated* link and you will be presented with a page with more details about the migration process.
+
image::module-01/NN_VMs_Migrating_Details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

*SAY:*

We can see here that two migrations have started, and one has not yet started.

NOTE: Yours may be different.
In the case documented here, winweb01 and winweb02 are located on the same ESXi Host, and our system is configured to migrate only one VM at a time from any one ESXi Host.

Now let's find out even more details about the specific stage of the migration process.

You can see the several stages of the migration process in the details panel.

Let's watch it for a moment before moving on.

*DO:*

. You can click the drop-down arrow next to the name of each VM being migrated to get additional details about the stages of the migration process.
+
image::module-01/NN_VM_Migration_Stages.png[link=self, window=blank, width=60%]
+
. The migration process is quite long and expensive, so display the changes for a few moments, and then move on.

. You can also show the logs of the migration process by clicking in *Plan Details* the tab *Virtual Machines*.
From there you can see the logs of each VM being migrated.
+
image::module-01/NN_VM_Migration_Logs.png[link=self, window=blank, width=60%]
+
image::module-01/NN_VM_Migration_Logs_View.png[link=self, window=blank, width=60%]

== Validate the Migrated Windows VMs and Application

*SAY:*

We've pre-migrated all three VMs. Let's start one of the Windows VMs and connect to it to have a look.

OpenShift separates work into different projects, and each project can have its own set of virtual machines.

Let's change to the project that contains our pre-migrated VMs.

*DO:*

. Click on *Virtualization* in the left menu, and then on *Virtual Machines*.

. Go to the Project: `vmimported`.

. Start the `winweb01` VM from the drop-down menus next to the VM name.
+
image::module-01/NN_Start_VMs.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Click on the `winweb01` VM that has started and click on its name to see the VM details page.
+
image::module-01/NN_VM_Name.png[link=self, window=blank, width=40%]

*SAY:*

On this page we can see many details about the VMs that have been migrated to OpenShift Virtualization, especially the Windows desktop.

image::module-01/NN_VM_Details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Now let's look at the application migrated and exposed to our organization.

*DO:*

. Click Networking in the left menu, and then click on *Routes*.

. There should only be one route, `route-webapp`

. Click the *Location* link and your browser will open with the web application, showing the visitor counter and the web server hostname.
+
image::module-01/NN_VM_Networking_Routes.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. The application should look something like this
+

== Summary

*SAY:*

In this demo, we used the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization to assist with the migration of existing virtual machines from a VMware vSphere environment to OpenShift Virtualization.

In addition to the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization, there are three other migration toolkits.

The combination of these can be used to move many types of workloads into and within OpenShift clusters depending on your organization’s needs.

For more information about these other migration toolkits, please reach out to your Red Hat account team.

*DO:*

NOTE: Please delete this demo from the Red Hat Demo Platform as soon as you have completed practicing or delivering the demo to your customer.
