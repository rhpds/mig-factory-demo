*SAY:*

The search engine within Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes enables rapid troubleshooting and resource discovery across your Kubernetes clusters, including virtual machines, by providing a centralized and powerful search capability. With this feature, users can quickly locate specific resources, such as pods, nodes, and VMs, by using intuitive search queries and filters. This streamlined search functionality reduces the complexity of navigating large, multi-cluster environments, allowing administrators to efficiently identify and address issues, optimize resource usage, and maintain a robust and well-managed Kubernetes infrastructure.

Let's showcase how the Search engine operates in ACM.

== Using ACM for Monitoring and Troubleshooting

*DO:*

. Navigate to the *Search* screen in ACM.
. Setup the following filters in your search *kind:VirtualMachine* 

image::module-03/acm-search-vms.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

. You should see the Virtual Machines you imported in the earlier steps, let's navigate deeper. Click on the *winweb01*

Notice all of the details of the Virtual Machine, here we can see when it was created, what Labels are appiled, what features of this virtual machine are enabled. If you navigate to the YAML tab you can see all of the details of the machine as Code, you can use this to deploy VMs as code from within ACM, making it super easy to scale out your environment.

. Feel free to explore around the search engine with other qureies, they are all simple text based.

*SAY:*

ACM provides powerful search capabilities to look at specific VM resources, related resources, and overall cluster health. This is especially useful for monitoring and troubleshooting, now let's dive deeper into Observability and showcase how we can monitor and alert on resources as needed.


*DO:*

. Navigate to the main ACM page and click on the *Grafana link* right below the search icon in ACM.

image::module-03/observability-Overview.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

. Click on the *local-cluster* under the *Top 50 Max Latency API Server* 

image::module-03/acm-observe-dash.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

. Notice the amount of information thats avaiable here from our cluster APIs, you can see what the top Requests are, and how many resources they consumed, by CPU, memory and much more. You can configure alerts from Grafana to be forward to any system that you might currently use for further monitoring and troubleshooting.

. Let's have a look at the workloads inside our cluster like Virtual Machines, let's Navigate to the side bar and click on *Browse* 

image::module-03/acm-observe-dash1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

. Once there notice all of the out of the box dashboards that are available. Custom dashboards can also be created and configure. Let's dive deeper into these dashboards and select the *ACM - OpenShift Virtualization Overview*  

image::module-03/acm-observe-dash2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

. This Dashboard showcases the Health of the *OpenShift Virtualization Operator* - kubevirt - and what resources - virtual machines - are available and and what the state is.

Feel free to explore around the multiple Grafana dashboards to familiarize yourself with whats included out of the box. 


*SAY:*

The Observability feature in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes enhances cluster resource management by providing comprehensive visibility into the health, performance, and utilization of cluster resources. By integrating with Grafana, it offers real-time monitoring and detailed dashboards that display key metrics for nodes, pods, and applications. This allows administrators to identify and address performance bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and ensure efficient operation of the clusters. The ability to set up alerts and analyze historical data further aids in proactive management, enabling better planning and timely resolution of potential issues, ultimately leading to a more resilient and well-optimized Kubernetes environment.

== Summary

*SAY:*

In this module, we demonstrated the centralized view and management capabilities of ACM, observed the deployment and monitoring of VMs, and highlighted the observability features that ensure the health and performance of our virtual machines.

By leveraging ACM, we can efficiently manage and scale our VM deployments across different infrastructures, ensuring consistency and reducing the potential for human error.

// In this module, we used ACM to deploy a VM on a ROSA hosted control plane managed cluster, leveraging GitOps for automation.
// This approach provides speed, scale, and consistency while simplifying the management of VMs.

// By using ACM and GitOps, we ensure that our VMs are deployed and managed efficiently, with built-in redundancy and robust monitoring capabilities.

*DO:*

NOTE: Please delete this demo from the Red Hat Demo Platform once you have completed practicing or delivering it to your customer.


// == Automating VM Deployment with ACM

// *SAY:*

// We will reproduce the VM deployment experience using ACM and the application engine for a more GitOps-based approach.

// *DO:*

// . Navigate to the *Applications* section in the ACM console.
// . Highlight the deployed applications, focusing on those using the GitOps model.

// *SAY:*

// In the screenshot, you can see a couple of applications deployed using the GitOps model.
// This approach allows for easy troubleshooting through the topology view.

// image::module-03/acm_applications.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

// == Creating a New Application with ACM

// *DO:*

// . Click on *Create Application*.
// . Select *Application Set* and choose the *Pull model* with Argo CD (OpenShift GitOps).
// . Enter the name for the application, select the GitOps Argo Server, and click *Next*.

// *SAY:*

// We will create a new application set using Argo CD for this deployment.
// First, we name our application, select the GitOps Argo Server, and proceed.

// *DO:*

// . Select *Git* for the Repo Type.
// . Enter the URL of the GitHub repository containing the VM configuration.

// *SAY:*

// This repository, forked from engineering, is dedicated to GitOps with OpenShift Virtualization.
// The key element we need is the VM configuration URL.

// image::module-03/git_repo_url.png[link=self, window=blank, width=80%]

// == Configuring the Application

// *DO:*

// . Paste the following repository *URL*:
// +
// {rhacm_gitops_repo}
// . Select the *Revision* `main` and *Path* `vms`.
// . Specify the target namespace as `openshift-cnv`.
// . Add label expression `name` | `equals any of` | `local-cluster`.

// *SAY:*

// We configure the application to deploy into the `openshift-cnv` namespace and place it appropriately into a managed OpenShift cluster.
// For this demo, we'll use the ROSA hosted control plane cluster.

// *DO:*

// . Click *Submit* to create the application.

// *SAY:*

// With the configuration set, we submit the application and observe the deployment process.

// == Observing the Deployment

// *DO:*

// . Switch to the ROSA console to monitor the VM deployment.
// . Highlight the VM status as it starts to come up.

// *SAY:*

// On the ROSA console, we can see the VM starting to come up and eventually running.
// ACM shows the application in a pending state initially, but it will soon reflect the running state.

// *DO:*

// . Switch to the ACM topology view to check the application status.

// *SAY:*

// In the ACM topology view, we can see the VM deployment progress. Once everything is green, the VM is deployed correctly.
// This view allows us to manage and troubleshoot the application easily.

// == GitOps Resiliency

// *SAY:*

// One of the benefits of deploying VMs as code with GitOps is built-in redundancy.
// If someone deletes the VM from the ROSA console, ACM will automatically recreate it, ensuring the application remains consistent.
